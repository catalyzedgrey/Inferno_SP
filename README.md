Sophomore year project.

This game is a 2D side scrolling platformer.

The game is comprised of three levels. The first has a basic enemy, moving projectiles, and a pool of lava.

The second introduces a new type of flying enemies in addition to the ones introduced in level one. 

The third level contains platforming aspects along with a basic boss fight.

The player is transported to each new level when they touch the purple portal. If they touch the one at the end of the third level, theyâ€™re brought back to the main menu screen.
